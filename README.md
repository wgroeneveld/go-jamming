# go-jammin' 🥞

Go module `brainbaking.com/go-jamming`:

> A minimalistic Go-powered jamstack-augmented microservice for webmentions etc

This is a set of minimalistic Go-based microservices that aid you in your [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) Jamstack coolness 😎. Currently, it handles **Webmentions** and **Pingbacks** for your statically generated website.

Go-jamming acts as an easy drop-in replacement for [webmention.io](https://webmention.io).

Usage is very simple, a `<link/>` in your `<head/>` suffices:

```
<link rel="webmention" href="https://jam.yourserver.com/webmention" />
<link rel="pingback" href="https://jam.yourserver.com/pingback" />
```

## How do I run/install this thing?

See [the installation guide: INSTALL.md](https://github.com/wgroeneveld/go-jamming/blob/master/INSTALL.md)!

## Can I see it in action?

Sure. These sites use it:

- https://brainbaking.com/
- https://jefklakscodex.com/
- https://redzuurdesem.be/

They leverage the client-side [jam-my-stack](https://github.com/wgroeneveld/jam-my-stack) JS scripts which call the appropriate APIs (see below). 

**How do I integrate it in Hugo/my static site**? See https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/05/beyond-webmention-io/

## What does it do?

### 1. Webmentions

#### 1.1 `POST /webmention`

Receive a webmention. Includes a _lot_ of cross-checking and validating to guard against possible spam. See the [W3C WebMention spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/#sender-notifies-receiver) - or the source - for details.

Accepted form format: 

```
    POST /webmention-endpoint HTTP/1.1
    Host: aaronpk.example
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    source=https://waterpigs.example/post-by-barnaby&
    target=https://aaronpk.example/post-by-aaron
```

Will result in a `202 Accepted` - it handles things async. Stores mentions in a **to approve** and **approved** database separately. 

This also saves the author picture/avatar locally - if present in the microformat. It does _not_ resize images, however, if it's bigger than 5 MB, it falls back to a default one. 

Publication dates are sanitized and stored in `published`. They should be formatted in ISO8601. See [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). 
If that is not the case, go-jamming falls back to the moment the mention was received. 

#### 1.2 `GET /webmention/:domain/:token`

Retrieves a JSON array with relevant webmentions stored for that domain. The token should match. See configuration to fiddle with it yourself. 

Example response:

```js
{
  "status": "success",
  "json": [
    {
      "author": {
        "name": "Jefklak",
        "picture": "/pictures/jefklakscodex.com"
      },
      "name": "Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield - 17 Years Later",
      "content": "It’s amazing that the second disk is still readable by my Retro WinXP machine. It has been heavily abused in 2003 and the years after that. Rainbow Six' third installment, Raven Shield (or simply RvS), is quite a departure from the crude looking Rogu...",
      "published": "2020-11-01",
      "url": "https://jefklakscodex.com/articles/retrospectives/raven-shield-17-years-later/",
      "type": "mention",
      "source": "https://jefklakscodex.com/articles/retrospectives/raven-shield-17-years-later/",
      "target": "https://brainbaking.com/post/2020/10/building-a-core2duo-winxp-retro-pc/"
    }
  ]
}
```

A few remarks:

- `picture`: Author picture paths are relative to the jamming server since they're locally stored. 
- `published`: This is not processed and simply taken over from the microformat.
- `target` is your domain, `source` is... well... the source. 
- `content`: Does not contain HTML. Automatically capped at 250 characters if needed.
- Pictures and authors are anonymized if coming from a silo webmention server such as brid.gy to respect the author's privacy. See https://sebastiangreger.net/2018/05/indieweb-privacy-challenge-webmentions-backfeeds-gdpr/

#### 1.3 `PUT /webmention/:domain/:token`

Sends out **both webmentions and pingbacks**, based on the domain's `index.xml` RSS feed, and optionally, a `since` request query parameter that is supposed to be a string, fed through [Dayjs](https://day.js.org/) to format. (e.g. `2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z`). 

This does a couple of things:

1. Fetch RSS entries (since last sent link x, or everything)
2. Find outbound `href`s (starting with `http`)
3. Check if those domains have a `webmention` link endpoint installed, according to the w3.org rules. If not, check for a `pingback` endpoint. If not, bail out.
4. If webmention/pingback found: `POST` for each found href with `source` the own domain and `target` the outbound link found in the RSS feed, using either XML or form data according to the protocol. 

As with the `POST` call, will result in a `202 Accepted` and handles things async/in parallel. 

**Does this thing take updates into account**?

Yes and no. It checks the `<link/>` tag to see if there's a new post since mentions were last sent. If a new link is discovered, it will send out those. 

This means if you made changes in-between, and they appear in the RSS feed as recent items, it will get resend. 

**Do I have to provide a ?source= parameter each time**?

No. The server will automatically store the latest push, and if it's called again, it will not send out anything if nothing more recent was found in your RSS feed based on the last published link. Providing the parameter merely lets you override the behavior.

**Which RSS feed will it use?**

It will attempt to auto-discover them with a HEAD call, in the following order:

1. `/all/index.xml`
2. `/index.xml`
3. `/feed`
4. `/feed/index.xml`

If none provied a status of 200 with a Content-Type that contains `xml`, it will abort and log an error. 

Note that this _requires your site to be on HTTPS_!! 

#### 1.4 `DELETE /webmention/:domain/:token?source=x&target=y`

Deletes a webmention or logs a warning if no relevant mention found. 

### 2. Pingbacks

Pingbacks are in here for two reasons:

1. I wanted to see how difficult it was to implement them. Turns out to be almost exactly the same as webmentions. This means the "new" W3 standards for webmentions are just as crappy as pingbacks... What's the difference between a form POST and an XML POST? Form factor?
2. Much more blogs (Wordpress-alike) support only pingbacks. 

#### 2.1 `POST /pingback`

Receive a pingback. Includes a _lot_ of cross-checking and validating to guard against possible spam. Internally, converts it into a webmention and processes it just like that.

Accepted XML body: 

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodCall>
    <methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>
    <params>
        <param>
            <value><string>https://brainbaking.com/kristien.html</string></value>
        </param>
        <param>
            <value><string>https://kristienthoelen.be/2021/03/22/de-stadia-van-een-burn-out-in-welk-stadium-zit-jij/</string></value>
        </param>
    </params>
</methodCall>
```

Will result in a `200 OK` - that returns XML according to [The W3 pingback XML-RPC spec](https://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback#refsXMLRPC). Processes async. 

#### 2.2 Sending pingbacks

Happens automatically through `PUT /webmention/:domain/:token`! Links that are discovered as `rel="pingback"` that **do not** already have a webmention link will be processed as XML-RPC requests to be send. 

### 3. Keep track of mentions

#### 3.1 `GET /feed/[domain]/[token]`

To keep track of all incoming mentions, simply subscribe to the above URL for each of your domains using your favorite RSS reader. 

Mentions to approve also appear in the feed, together with links to accept or reject them with a single click! (See below, section "mentions in moderation").

#### 3.2 SMTP `localhost`

Messages of incoming mentions can also be sent via e-mail if you have a localhost SMTP server setup. See the `INSTALL.md` for more instructions and config parameters on how to do so.

## Troubleshooting

Run in verbose mode: use `-verbose`. This also logs debug info. Structured JSON is outputted through os.Stderr - which is usually `/var/log/syslog`. 

If rolling files in a separate location is required, [lumberjack](https://github.com/natefinch/lumberjack) could be added in `main.go`.

There's a **rate limiting** system implemented with a rate limit of 5 requests per second and a maximum burst rate of 10. 
That's pretty flexible. I have not taken the trouble to put this into the config, it should do in most cases. If you get a `429 too many requests`, you've hit the limiter. 
A separate goroutine cleans up ips each 2 minutes, the TTL is 5 minutes. See `limiter.go`. 

Database migrations are run using the `-migrate` flag.

## Fighting spam

Since Go-jamming still supports Pingbacks, spam could be an issue. However, if the URL doesn't contain a genuine link, the mention will be immediately dropped.

Still, spammers always find a way and sometimes even create fake blog posts with real links to your blog. 

### Mentions _in moderation_

Go-Jamming employs a `whitelist` and `blacklist` system. By default, all mentions end up in a moderation queue, another database that will not pollute the mention db.

Each mention has to be manually approved. An e-mail to `localhost:25` (a local Postfix) will be sent out with approve/reject links, if configured. Otherwise, the endpoint `/admin/{token}` is the dashboard where you can approve/reject from time to time:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wgroeneveld/go-jamming/master/adminpanel.jpg)

Approved mentions will have their domain added to the whitelist. Rejected mentions will have their domain added to the blacklist. 

Read more about how spam moderation works at https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/04/fighting-webmention-and-pingback-spam/

### Manually blacklisting partial domains

In that case, simply add the domain to the `blacklist` in `config.json`.

Adding this **manually** will not remove existing spam in your DB! The `-blacklist` flag is there to:

1. Automatically add it to the `blacklist` array in the config file;
2. Automatically search the DB for all allowed domains for spam from the blacklist and remove it. (Check for string match on the URL)

How to use: `./go-jamming -blacklist annoyingspam.com`. This will exit after the above actions. Then you can simply restart the server with `./go-jamming`.
